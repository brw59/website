					<h4>Profile</h4>
					<p id="myAge"></p>
					<p>I am the second of 5 kids</p>
					<p>I am a pretty good chess player</p>
					<p>I am an Eagle Scout</p>
					<p>I love outdoor activities including: spelunking, rock climbing, repelling, wakeboarding, sand duning, making toys/puzzles, swimming, diving, paintball, scubadiving (in Hawaii, because it's warmer)</p>
					<p>I do a lot of things with my family, including trips to St George, UT for recreation activities, hawaii, cruises, family reunions, dinners together, when we're in reach of each other, playing board games, making delicous food, </p>
					<p>I have spent a significant amount of time the last couple years teaching my friends (and a couple cousins) how to program in C++ and Java and have found surprising joy in doing so. At the current time I only help one friend, and it's mostly debugging Java. I am going to make a strong effort to teach my future kids how to do so though.</p>
					<p>Of course there are a whole lot of things that I want to do that I haven't done yet, so if you're in the mood to do some of these things, let me know and maybe I'll do them with you!:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Skydiving</li>
						<li>Start up a bunch of companies (I have my own list of ideas, some of which I've already done the research for)</li>
						<li>Post the iOS apps I already know how to make in Swift to the App Store</li>
						<li>Learn how to use Unity</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h4>Education</h4>
					<p>B.S. in Computer Science at BYU-Idaho</p>
					<p>I start Grad School to get a Masters in Computer Science in Fall 2016. I'm enrolled in BYU-Provo's program</p>
