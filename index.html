					<h4>Profile</h4>
					<p id="myAge"></p>
					<p>I am the second of 5 kids</p>
					<p>I am a pretty good chess player</p>
					<p>I am an Eagle Scout</p>
					<p>I love outdoor activities including: spelunking, rock climbing, repelling, wakeboarding, sand duning, making toys/puzzles, swimming, diving, paintball, scubadiving (in Hawaii, because it's warmer)</p>
					<p>I do a lot of things with my family, including trips to St George, UT for recreation activities, hawaii, cruises, family reunions, dinners together. When we're in close proximity: playing family games and making delicous food. </p>
					<p>I have spent a significant amount of time the last couple years teaching my friends (and a couple cousins) how to program in C++ and Java and have found surprising joy in doing so. I spend significant time striving to not tell, rather teach how to learn. Many of the questions that were asked I would show them the process I'd go through to figure it out, then have them follow suit in figuring out how to answer their own questions. I seek to teach my future posterity at least the basics of this skill set as to encourage them to be at the very least, aware of what the cabibilities are.</p>
					<p>Of course there are a whole lot of things that I want to do that I haven't done yet, so if you're in the mood to do some of these things, let me know and I might just do them with you!:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Skydiving</li>
						<li>Start up a bunch of companies (I have my own list of ideas, some of which I've already done the research for)</li>
						<li>Launch the iOS apps I already know how to make to the App Store</li>
						<li>Learn how to use Unity</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Education</h4>
					<p>B.S. in Computer Science at BYU-Idaho</p>
					<p>I start Grad School to get a Masters in Computer Science in Fall 2016. I'm enrolled in BYU-Provo's program</p>

				<h3>Resume</h3>
				<p>I strive to develop metacognitive habits; In other words, I spend time seeking to improve my own productiveness, behavior, effect on others, experience, and what environments I work best in. </p>

							A Turing Machine is capable of solving every problem. If you don't know what a turing machine is, go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">here</a>. I used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic finite automaton</a> to complete this project using JFLAP.
							<br>
							To the right is a video of how my 3 Tape Turning Machine works with binary numbers to multiply together.
							<br>
							I have it working for unary through decimal. Binary doesn't take long to demonstrate, and the rest is messy compared to the binary .jff file, so I used binary for the video.

							I worked for half of a semester on this project. The point of this project was to use the computer graphic principles that we learned for the first half on the semester and apply it to something in a self picked project.

							Part of what I got to do was present this project at Creative Works and Research Conference. For this conference I demonstrated the simulation for a judge and I made a <a href="./files/projects/cloth_animation/Cloth%20Simulation.pdf">poster</a> to go with it.
